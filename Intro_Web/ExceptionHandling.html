    <p>Exception handling is a mechanism in programming languages to manage and respond to errors or unexpected events that occur during program execution.</p>
    <p>
        <u><b>Try-Catch Block:</b></u> A code block that encloses the code that might throw an exception.<br/>
        <u><b>Catch Block: </b></u>A code block that handles a specific type of exception. It is executed when an exception of that type is thrown within the try block.<br/>
        <u><b>Finally Block:</b></u> A code block that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. It's often used for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources.<br/>
        <u><b>Throw Keyword: </b></u>Used to explicitly throw an exception.<br/>
        <u><b>Throws Keyword: </b></u>Used to declare that a method might throw a specific type of exception.<br/>
